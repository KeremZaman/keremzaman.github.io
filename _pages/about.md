I'm currently a fourth-year PhD student at the UNC-Chapel Hill where I am advised by [Shashank Srivastava](https://www.ssriva.com/). My research focuses on interpretable and explainable NLP, AI safety, reasoning, fairness, and robustness. My ultimate goal is to advance **safe** and **transparent** AI systems by deepening our understanding of black-box models.

I spent my summer (2025) at [IFM MBZUAI Silicon Valley Lab](https://ifm.mbzuai.ac.ae/) with [Mikhail Yurochkin](https://moonfolk.github.io/). Before PhD, I earned my bachelor's degree from the Department of Computer Engineering Boğaziçi University, where my thesis advisor was [Pinar Yanardag](https://pinguar.org/).
