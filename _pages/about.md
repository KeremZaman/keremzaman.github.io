I'm currently a second-year PhD student at the UNC-Chapel Hill where I am advised by [Shashank Srivastava](https://www.ssriva.com/). 

Before PhD, I earned my bachelor's degree from the Department of Computer Engineering Boğaziçi University, where my thesis advisor was [Pinar Yanardag](https://pinguar.org/).

I'm interested in  interpretable and explainable machine learning, multilingual NLP, Large Language Models (LLMs). robustness and fairness. My ultimate research goal is to enhance our understanding of black-box models.
